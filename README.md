# Pokeapi project

Deployed on https://pokeapi-joselws.herokuapp.com/pokemons

Simple project using the pokeapi site. It's a simple pokedex which renders a few Pokemon initially. You can go to the next page to see the following pokemon or go to the previous page also. You can click on the pokemon's name to see additional detailed information about it. There is also a search bar in which you can look for pokemons by their name or by their number.
